# Master's Degree in Video game programming at U-Tad
## Scripting

Practices for the subject Scripting.

* Practice 1: Introduction: Lua operations.
* Practice 2: Control structures.
* Practice 3: Tables.
* Practice 4: Objects.
* Practice 5: Coroutines.
* Practice 6: Lua from C++.
* Practice 7: C++ from Lua.

**For this subject, I've only included the codes, not all the process to execute them.**
This is because the configuration to execute them is a bit messy, so I've written below what I used but you can run them any other way. 

### My configuration
* I've used [DECODA](https://unknownworlds.com/decoda/) as the IDE to compile the codes but you will need [MOAI SDK](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1yTzb58-4ohLcq7kkeUHVy7taopb8woCf/view?usp=sharing) to have a library that process images.
* For the last 2 practices, I've used Microsoft VS 2019 and Atom for the Lua part.
